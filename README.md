# Trade Cred Project
The link to the deployed web application ( Frontend + Backend ) is ***https://trade-cred-project.herokuapp.com/***

Use the excel sheet provided in the repository to test the website, as the code works on Case-Sensitive column names.
The code displays -
##### -> Number of invoices uploaded
##### -> The total sum of invoice amounts
##### -> Total number of vendors whose invoices were uploaded.
##### -> Total number of invalid invoices.

Validation occurs on the basis :-
  1) Invoice dates (Pstng Date) should not be future dated.
  2) A vendor must be assigne to a invoice.
  3) Duplicate invoices (Invoice Numbers) are invalid.
